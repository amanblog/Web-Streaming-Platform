# Web-Streaming-Platform
A Music Streaming Platform with Laravel.

A music streaming platform where users can not only listen to music but can upload your own music to it! You can also create your own playlist and add songs to it.

When you log in to the dashboard and upload your song, it extracts the information from the song and fill the details like Title, Artist, Album etc, automatically. You can also change it anytime. Multiple artists can be assigned to a song. When a song is uploaded, its corresponding album and artist pages are also created. 

It also has Trending and Top charts available. Both these playlist are updated automatically on the basis of number of times an audio has been played. Artists's details can be updated like picture and about section. You can also search through the site for album, song or artist.
